# Svelte UI [WIP]

Svelte UI is a UI component library that aims to deliver a production ready set of pieces which will make creating your templates a lot easier.

A configuration file can be used to globally modify the appearance of all the components, from forms to buttons etc.

I am currently using Tailwind CSS but there is a chance I might be dropping this soon in favour of traditional CSS, will see what works best.
